"""
Compression Module for Asynchronous Image Processing.

This module provides the core image compression functionality used by
the asynchronous image compressor. It includes an adaptive and optimized
compression function that:

- Reads large images efficiently using OpenCV's reduced color loading.
- Encodes images to WebP in memory using `cv2.imencode` (faster than imwrite).
- Minimizes memory copies between numpy arrays and OpenCV.
- Supports downscaling via `scale_factor` to reduce size further.
- Ensures compatibility with ARM-based Macs (M1/M2/M3) and leverages NEON vectorization.

The main function:
    - adaptive_compression: Compresses a single image efficiently.

Usage:
    from compression import adaptive_compression

    orig_size, new_size, elapsed = adaptive_compression(
        "images/photo.jpg",
        "compressed/photo.webp",
        scale_factor=0.8,
        quality=70
    )

    Adaptive and optimized image compression using OpenCV.

    This function compresses a single image to WebP format with optional downscaling.
    It is designed for high performance on both Intel and ARM architectures.

    Features:
        - Fast loading of large images using cv2.IMREAD_REDUCED_COLOR_*.
        - Optional downscaling to reduce memory usage and speed up processing.
        - In-memory WebP encoding with `cv2.imencode` (faster than writing via cv2.imwrite).
        - Automatic directory creation for output path.
        - Detailed logging on read/encode failures.

    Parameters:
        image_path (str): Absolute or relative path to the source image.
        output_path (str): Absolute or relative path where the compressed WebP image will be saved.
        start_total (float, optional): Timestamp marking start of total operation for logging purposes.
        scale_factor (float, optional): Factor to downscale the image before compression (0 < scale_factor <= 1.0).
                                        Default is 0.8 (reduce size to 80%).
        quality (int, optional): WebP compression quality (0-100). Higher means better quality but larger size.
                                 Default is 70.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int, float]: A tuple containing:
            - original_size_bytes (int): Size of the input image in bytes.
            - new_size_bytes (int): Size of the compressed WebP image in bytes.
            - elapsed_time_seconds (float): Time taken to compress this image.

    Raises:
        Logs errors instead of raising exceptions for:
            - Failure to read the image.
            - Failure to encode the image.
            - Any other unexpected exception during processing.

    Example:
        orig_size, new_size, elapsed = adaptive_compression(
            "images/photo.jpg",
            "compressed/photo.webp",
            scale_factor=0.75,
            quality=80
